# hermitd
hermitd is the hermit crab living inside the shell, and just like a hermit, can give you useful suggestions :D

## Getting Started
I recommend setting up a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv .venv`. 

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the needed dependencies.

Currently run using `python3 -m hermitd`.

Also remember to run `black hermitd/` before commits.
